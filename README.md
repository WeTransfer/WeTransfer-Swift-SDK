## Features

- [x] Create and upload a transfer from a single method call
- [x] Seperate methods for each seperate step in the process
- [ ] Cancelling and resuming uploads

## Requirements
- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.10+
- Xcode 9.4+
- Swift 4.2+

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate WeTransfer into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "WeTransfer/WeTransfer-Swift-SDK" ~> 2.0
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `WeTransfer.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding the WeTransfer SDK as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

#### Swift 4

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Alamofire/WeTransfer-Swift-SDK.git", from: "2.0")
]
```

**Note:** Running `swift test` doesn’t work currently as Swift packages can’t have resources in their test targets.

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

To integrate the WeTransfer Swift SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```rubygi
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'WeTransfer-Swift-SDK', '>= 2.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage
Before the SDK can do anything with the WeTransfer API, it needs to be authenticated with an API key. You can create an API key at the [developer portal](https://developers.wetransfer.com)

1. Configure the client
Create a configuration with your API key
```swift
let configuration = WeTransfer.Configuration(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
WeTransfer.configure(with: configuration)
```
2. Uploading files with a new transfer
Creating a transfer and uploading files to it can be done with one method call, `WeTransfer.uploadTransfer`. Files in the SDK are represented by `File` objects, but this convenience methods expects an array of `URL`s pointing to files on your device.
In the `stateChanged` closure you’re updated about things like the upload progress or whether is has completed or failed
```swift
let files = [...]
WeTransfer.uploadTransfer(saying: "Transfer Name", containing: files) { state in
    switch state {
    case .created(let transfer):
        print("Transfer created")
    case .uploading(let progress):
        print("Transfer uploading")
    case .completed(let transfer):
        print("Upload completed")
    case .failed(let error):
        XCTFail("Transfer failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

## Sample Application
<p align="center">
    <img src="Assets/SampleApplication.gif" alt="WeTransfer Swift SDK Sample Application" />
</p>
Included with the project is a neat little sample application that shows a possible use case for the SDK. It allows for photos and videos to be added to a transfer and shows the upload progress for the whole transfer, aAfter which the URL can be shared.
